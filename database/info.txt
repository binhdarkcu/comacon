2. slider
The client has added a post here and the image doesn't automatically crop so it shows the whole image, how can we solve this so the image always shows nice?

3.- can we have this content in the cms? -> yes, we have it in cms

4. fix colour of font => checked design (true font and color)

5.ABOUT COMACON: 
- colours and fonts are not matching design (attached again)
- picture to integrate and align on right as in design:
- How to adjust the texts on the left, under 'Waarom Comacon'?

6.DIENSTEN
- colours and fonts are not matching design (attached again) also pls pay attention to titles in capitals etc...
- take off 'Download onze brochure' and PDF link

NEW: we will work with icons in the content for 'SERVICES' means that if you look at this attachment you will see every services is visualised 

7.REFERENCE DETAIL
check: images on the right are stretched, the ones that are long are now squeezed, pls keep same proportions
- links behind images on the right are all pointing to a different image
-left, we change the copy here slightly, this part must be included in cms
-- construction datum -> startdatum werkzaamheden
-- location -> bouwplaats
-- investeerder -> klant
-- waarde -> partners (this will be a list of partners and each partner with link to their website)

8.REFERENCE DETAIL 
Under here we will have the service icons, this will list the services comacon did for this project, this must be included in the cms with a tickbox for each service, there will be a hover- rollover with what this icon means. See services page for naming (HAALBAARHEID - ONTWERP - PRIJSAANVRAGEN - BESTELLING - UITVOERING - VERKOOP EN MARKETING)
So some projects will include all the services, others only a few, this must me in the cms
